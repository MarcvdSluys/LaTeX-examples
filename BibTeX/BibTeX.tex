\section{Introduction}

This document is intended to show my favourite use of BibTeX in \LaTeX\ (depending on the target) with a simple example.
An example of a citation is the \emph{C Programming Language Cheat Sheet} \cite{Choudhary}.  Also, I use the gcc
C compiler \cite{gcc} a lot, since it is freely available for everybody.

This is a citation to a real paper \cite{leung1980scheduling}.  And this is how I cite Wikipedia \cite{wiki:Cron}.

Note that:
\begin{itemize}
\item I use a BibTeX style (*.bst) that I hacked together from number.bst, but where I made sure urls can be
  used.  The original was by Patrick W.\ Daly, but I can't seem to find the original and hence what exactly it
  is I changed\ldots
\item I can use more than one BibTeX file (*.bib)
\item Only the entries from my BibTeX files that are \emph{actually cited} are listed in the bibliography.
\end{itemize}
